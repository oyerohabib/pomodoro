# üçÖ Pomodoro

This timer [app](https://our-pomodoro.netlify.app/), built with React and TypeScript, is designed to enhance productivity. I developed it as a side project to learn new skills and customize features to better suit my personal workflow, which has significantly improved my daily task management.
